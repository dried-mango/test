**Description:**

>Robin handed me some [color](codes.txt) codes the other day. They don't look like anything to me though. Can you help me find her favorite shade of red?

**Hint:**

> Once again, there are tools on the interwebz that can help! (There's a clear theme here, from the easiest pico problems, to the hardest ones in other CTFs, search engines are your friend!)
